# Elevator_Project_C_Sharp
Creating an Elevator in C# 

The code is written in C# and was created from an assignment point of view. It utilizes the interface provided by Visual Studio. 
It also uses a compilation of moving images, sounds and animated gifs to give it a more elevator feel / experience. 
The project is only a simulator for an elevator.
